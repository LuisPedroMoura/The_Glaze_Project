# The_Glaze_Project
Simple Image Editor

My part on a Computer Science First Year Project. The project was an Online Meme Generator.

This module features the Image Editor with some Effects and Filters. The challenge was to
edit the images directly with pixel manipulation without any available library editing methods.
I included a command line menu.

Necessary python packages:
PIL (pip install image)

Run:
cd <project folder>
python simpleImageEditor.py

Works with Python 3.7.3
